**Slide 1**
- Hello, I'm going to present my report on the experimental activity: "Synthesis of a high Tc cuprate superconductor through solid state reaction route"

**ToC**
- Here we have the table of contents of this presentation

**Intro**
- First, let's do an introduction of this subject

**Superconductors**
- Superconductors are materials that can conduct electricity with zero resistance below a certain critical temperature
- Of course, this has many important implications in technology
- On the right, we can see the characteristic resistance vs temperature curve of a superconductor. At the critical temperatue, Tc, it's resistance abruptly drops to zero

**Solid state**
- Solid state reaction route is the type of process we employed to synthethise this compund
- It consists of developing a chemical reaction in way that all the reagents and wanted products stay in the solid state all the way through
- To achieve that, we repeat two basic processes repeatedly:
    - Calcination, which consists of heating a sample to remove impurities or volatile substances, without melting
    - Sintering, which is when we compact or heat a material to make it solid

**ybco-1**
- Now, let's see the superconductor we aim to synthethise: YBCO
- It is known for having a high Tc, of around 90K
- As we can see on the right, it has an orthorhombic structure
- The superconductivity of YBCO happens thanks to its Copper and O2 planes. However, a normal Copper and O2 plane would be a Mott insulator, because of the electronic configuration.
- So, superconductive YBCO has oxygen deficiency. Because of that, we have holes in the planes and the electrons can hop between Copper atoms without any resistance.
- This deficiency is represented by the parameter delta, so the actual name of the compound is ytrium, barium 2, copper 3, oxygen 7-delta

**ybco-2**
- Here we can see the different sections of YBCO, where we can see the important copper and O2 planes marked. Because of the presence of these structures, YBCO is called a cuprate
- We can also see the Tc measured for different deltas. As delta gets higher, the amount of holes starts being too high and the hopping of the electrons is more difficult. If delta is above 0.55 the material is no longer superconductive

**exp**
- Now we are going to see the process followed and a few details of the processes done

**steps**
1. We calculated the amounts of each reagent needed
2. Then we measured those quantities and mixed them using mortar and pestle
3. We cold pressed this powder into pellets using an hydraulic press
4. Next, we calcinated the pellets at 820C for 6 hours
5. The previous step is repeated if the samples present greeen spots
6. Then, the samples are grinded and pressed into pellets for a second time. Afterwards, they were calcinated at 930C for 60h with oxygen flux
7. We repeat the previous step
8. The samples are grinded and pressed for a fourth time. Finally, they are sintered at 940C for 24h
9. Then they are cooled down to 500C and kept at that temperature for 72h.
10. Finally, the samples are cooled to room temperature
11. The samples can be analyzed in X ray diffraction to check their superconductivity

**mixing**
- In every class, every group started by grinding the samples using mortar and pestle for around 20-30min
- We added ethanol for the mixture to help homogenize it

**XRD**
- X-ray diffraction was used in e every class, after grinding the samples into powder
- We used the rigaku smartlab XRD, which is speciallized for XRD with powder samples
- The samples are put in glass supports. Glass is chosen because it is amorphous and doesn't have any diffraction peaks.
- The software did the vertical alignment of the sample and the X-ray source automatically
- We compared the XRD spectra measured with data obtained from cif files

**cold press**
- After diffraction, in each class, the samples were pressed into pellets.
- We used a manual hydraulic press, where we put the samples at 4000 PSI for 30 seconds, using the support shown on the right
- After being pelletized, the samples were removed from the support with the press

**calcination**
- Finally, in every class the samples were left in the furnace to be calcinated or sintered. To do this, the pellets are placed in ceramic supports, as shown here.
- If O2 flux is needed, the sample is placed in a glass tube with a glass bubbler in one end.

**results**
- Now we are going to see the results obtained by each group, week by week

**week 1**
- The solid state reaction we want to make is represented by this equation
- We consider delta to be zero, to calculate the masses needed. 
- First, we easily calculate the molar mass of each reagent and of YBCO
- Then, considering we want to make 1 gram of YBCO, we can determine how many mols of YBCO that is

**week 1-2**
- Using the stoichiometric proportions, we can finally determine the mass needed for each reagent:
- Then, for 1 gram of YBCO, we calculated these masses of yttrium oxide, barium carbonate and copper oxide.

**week 2**
- In this week, the students started by measureing these masses of each reagent. This are the amounts needed to make two samples of YBCO with 1.2g each
- After mixing everything together, the group measured the xray diffraction spectrum for one of the samples, which we can see above
- As expected, the spectrum is a mixture of the sepctra of the 3 reagents. We can also see that this spectrum resembles *barium carbonate*'s spectrum the most. That makes sense, as that is the reagent present in the highest quantity. We can also see a high peak of *ytrium oxide*
- We can also see a bump at low angles. This is caused by the glass samples. Glass being amorphous means that it doesn't have peaks, but some X-ray diffraction still happens

**week 3**
- In this class we can see the spectra of both samples, which are identical
- Most of the *ytrium carbonate* peaks decreased or disappeared, which indicates that most of these structures have broken apart in this calcination step
- Most of the *barium carbonate* peaks are still present and now are higher. 
- Two peaks of *copper oxide* also increase

**week 4**
- We now see the highest difference between the samples. 
- Sample A still presents a lot of peaks of *barium carbonate* and of *copper oxide*
- Sample B however doesn't present this peaks nearly as much. *(desaparecem circulos)*
- Instead, it presents a *lot of peaks that don't match any reagent*. So, from this week onwards, I also compare the spectra to the spectrum of YBCO
- *In the bottom plot*, we can see that these peaks match with YBCO. This indicates that the solid state process is working.
- The differences between the samples indicate that Sample A is behind in the reaction process. While in B most of the reagents' structures had broken and YBCO started forming, in A the two groups seem to be present at the same time

**week 5**
- The peaks of both samples are once again identical. This confirms that sample B was delayed, but now they both are in the same phase of the reaction
- Now, neither samples has a high peak matching a reagent. Any reagent peak present *is also a peak of YBCO*
- The reaction is close to finished
- Both samples are identical and neither looks better, so the students decided to sinter sample A with oxygen flux and sample B without

**final samples**
- The spectra barely changed when compared to the previous week, which indicates that the process was close to finished. 
- The spectra of the sampels are identical to that of YBCO, with the exception of the glass bump in low angles
- The only noticeable difference in the sample spectra is *this small bump*  that matches barium carbonate. This might be because during this final calcination, sample B was in an air atmosphere so Carbon from carbon dioxide in the air could have mixed with the sample and reformed barium carbonate. Sample A was in an atmosphere of oxygen so this couldn't happen.
- Besides the spectrums of the samples looking really similar to YBCO, it *doesn't match completely*, specially at higher angles

**final samples-2**
- So I decided to compare these spectra to variations of YBCO I could find online. 
- The one I found to match the best was YBCO-6.9. In this plots we can see the comparison.
- We immediately see that the *peaks that didn't match* YBCO-7 match YBCO-6.9 much better
- In the bottom plot we can a zoomed in version, comparing the two YBCO variants. It becomes even clearer that these samples match YBCO-6.9 and not YBCO-7
- This variant has delta equal to 0.1, which means that the samples should be superconductive, with a Tc below 90K, but still close to it.

**conclusions**
- Finally, let's recapitulate and gather our conclusions from this work

**fim**
- Over 5 weeks, we were able to synthethise YBCO, a high Tc cuprate superconductor
- The final Xray diffraction data indicates that we fabricated YBCO-6.9, not YBCO-7. This is still a superconductive with a high Tc
- Finally, we saw that removing the O2 flux in the final sintering step did not affect the xray spectrum very much. In fact, the sample only presents a slight difference, and it could even be superconductor.
